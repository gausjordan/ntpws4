			<h2>There is no spoon</h2>
			<p class="description">There really isn't. A 39 year old tourist from Jesenice, Slovenia, found himself shocked in awe, as he experienced a true-to-life matrixian epiphany - straight from the Ethos!</p>
			<p>The third one has to be about Myst - the first CD-ROM game I've ever played.</p>
			<p>I realized, the moment I fell into the fissure, that the Book would not be destroyed as I had planned. It continued falling into that starry expanse, of which I had only a fleeting glimpse. I have tried to speculate where it might have landed—I must admit, however, such conjecture is futile. Still, the question of whose hands might one day hold my Myst Book are unsettling to me. I know my apprehensions might never be allayed, and so I close, realizing that perhaps the ending has not yet been written.</p>
			<p>Catherine, my love, I have to leave quickly. Something terrible has happened. It's hard for me to believe... most of my Books have been destroyed. Catherine, it's one of our sons! I suspect Achenar, but I shouldn't jump to conclusions. I'll find him, and Sirrus as well. Oh, I should have known better than to have left my library unchecked for so long!</p>
			<p>Well, I've removed the remaining undamaged Books from the library, and placed them in their places of protection. You shouldn't have to use the Books until I return, but if you've forgotten the access key, remember the tower rotation. Oh, and don't worry, Catherine, everything will be fine. I'll see you shortly. Oh, and erase this message after you've viewed it, just to be safe.</p>
			<p>Ah, my friend! You've returned – we meet face-to-face. And the page, did you bring the page? … [Sighs] You didn't bring the page. You didn't bring the page! [thumps the book he is writing in - the Book of Riven - in frustration] What kind of fool are you? Ah! Did you not take my warning seriously? [Long pause] Welcome to D'ni. You and I will live here … forever.</p>
