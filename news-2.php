			<h2>Gil Hibben joins the EcoPick engineering team</h2>
			<p class="description">Gil Hibben, a famous American custom knifemaker from Wyoming, known for his cinematic cutlery work, joins forces with EcoPick to build the toughest, most stylish pick as of yet.</p>
			<p>The second one, is one of Command & Conquer.</p>
			<p>So, you're the new addition to the Brotherhood. Well. I'm Seth. Just, Seth. From God, to Kane, to Seth. I am his right hand, and I have a task for you.</p>
			<p>This is Nicoomba. He has caused the Brotherhood much grief. His views do not coincide with ours, and that makes him dangerous. Silence him. </p>
			<p>Well done! You are truly becoming Kane's favorite. How would you like to ensure your place in the highest echelons of Nod? Surely you are ambitious enough to take on a mission of tremendous magnitude. Your goal is so secret even Kane knows nothing of it yet. You'll see, power shifts quickly in the brotherhood.</p>
			<p>I've taken the liberty of dispatching your troops to the U.S. Kane's been loathe to attack America, but I feel that it's time, and that you're the one to do it.</p>
